## Overview of the analysis
This project is intended to provide temperature trends in hawaii for the months of June and December. This info is wanted so a shop owner can determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Meaning, if the weather stays warm enough year round then these will be viable businesses. 
## Results
I was able to pull temperature data from a provided sqlite file that was made into a database. With this I used jupyter notebook to import the data and then filtered my data. Once the data was filtered I was then able to create dataframes using pandas.
